# StudyBuddyConnect
A project inspired by the scarcity of social media applications for classmate and study buddy collaborative work. 
I hope to create an environment for students to easily connect with one another in order to share and discuss 
information on relavant topics. This will allow students to quickly get feedback on homework problems or even share 
lecture notes of that day. While there are many other ways of sharing that information, this application brings 
simplicity and ease as all information is accessible in one place.
